# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 5: March 26, 2021 
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Wrote JSON from memory after watching 2 videos on how to format it.  It's been a long time since I've just copied and pasted, wanted to make sure I knew what to do so I could do it on the fly.

**Thoughts**: I struggle with posting on Twitter and the fear of being judged.  I don't know if I'm doing something wrong when using @ vs # and IF I'M SHOUTING LIKE IN EMAILS :D. 

**Link(s) to work**: [My JSON File](https://github.com/infinitesprints/100-days-of-code/blob/master/day5.json)
