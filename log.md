# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

##Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

##Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

##Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)

**Today's Progress**: Wrote JSON from memory after watching 2 videos on how to format it.  It's been a long time since I've just copied and pasted, wanted to make sure I knew what to do so I could do it on the fly.

**Thoughts**: I struggle with posting on Twitter and the fear of being judged.  I don't know if I'm doing something wrong when using @ vs # and IF I'M SHOUTING LIKE IN EMAILS :D.
